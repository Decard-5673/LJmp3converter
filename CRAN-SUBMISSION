Package: LJmp3converter
Version: 1.0.5

## Summary of Changes in Version 1.0.4:
- Removed dependency on `shiny` and replaced it with `rstudioapi` and `utils` for file selection.
- Ensured compliance with CRAN policies:
  - Added the required web service URL (`<https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip>`) in `DESCRIPTION`.
  - Documented return values for exported functions (e.g., added `@return` in `run_converter_app.R` and `download_ffmpeg.R`).
  - Replaced `installed.packages()` with `requireNamespace()` to avoid performance issues.
  - Removed package installation within functions (`install.packages()` calls).
  - Ensured all options are restored using `on.exit()` (e.g., `options(timeout = 3000)`).
- Updated `NEWS.md`, `README.md`, and `cran-comments.md` accordingly.

## Notes for CRAN Reviewers:
This resubmission addresses all feedback received in the previous CRAN review:
- `shiny` is fully removed, and the package now works with `rstudioapi` and `utils` for folder selection.
- All CRAN compliance issues (documentation, function behavior, and package dependencies) have been resolved.
- The package was tested on multiple environments, including Windows 11, Debian (r-devel), and `win-builder`.
