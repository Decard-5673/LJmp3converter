## Summary of Changes in Version 1.0.6:
- Added `merge_mp3()` function to merge multiple audio files into a single 'MP3'.
  - Uses `ffmpeg` for audio merging.
  - Allows interactive folder selection via `rstudioapi` and `utils`.
  - Converts non-MP3 audio files to MP3 before merging.
- Added `trim_audio()` function to trim audio files based on user-defined start and end times.
  - Uses `ffmpeg` for precise audio trimming.
  - Allows interactive file selection via `rstudioapi` and `utils`.
  - Supports input in hours, minutes, and seconds for accurate trimming.
  - Users can choose output format when trimming audio.
  
- Updated documentation:
  - Added `@return` details for `merge_mp3()` and `trim_audio()`.
  - Updated `NAMESPACE` to export `merge_mp3()` and `trim_audio()`.
- General package improvements:
  - Improved error handling and user messages.
  - Code refactoring for better consistency within the package.
  
## Notes for CRAN Reviewers:
This update introduces two new functions while maintaining CRAN compliance:
- `merge_mp3()` and `trim_audio()` follow the same structure as existing functions for consistency.
- FFmpeg is now handled efficiently, reducing unnecessary downloads.
- Documentation and function behaviors are aligned with CRAN guidelines.

All changes ensure the package remains lightweight, efficient, and compliant with CRAN policies.

## Summary of Changes in Version 1.0.5:
- Removed dependency on `shiny` and replaced it with `rstudioapi` and `utils` for file selection.
- Ensured compliance with CRAN policies:
  - Added the required web service URL (`<https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip>`) in `DESCRIPTION`.
  - Documented return values for exported functions (e.g., added `@return` in `run_converter_app.R` and `download_ffmpeg.R`).
  - Replaced `installed.packages()` with `requireNamespace()` to avoid performance issues.
  - Removed package installation within functions (`install.packages()` calls).
  - Ensured all options are restored using `on.exit()` (e.g., `options(timeout = 3000)`).
- Updated `NEWS.md`, `README.md`, and `cran-comments.md` accordingly.

## Notes for CRAN Reviewers:
This resubmission addresses all feedback received in the previous CRAN review:
- `shiny` is fully removed, and the package now works with `rstudioapi` and `utils` for folder selection.
- All CRAN compliance issues (documentation, function behavior, and package dependencies) have been resolved.
- The package was tested on multiple environments, including Windows 11, Debian (r-devel), and `win-builder`.
