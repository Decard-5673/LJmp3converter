## Resubmission: LJmp3converter 1.0.5

### Changes Made Based on CRAN Feedback:

1. **Fixed Documentation Issues**  
   - Added `@return No return value, called for side effects.` to `run_converter_app.Rd`.  
   - Ensured proper URL formatting (`<https:...>`) in `DESCRIPTION`.  

2. **Removed Prohibited Functions**  
   - Removed `installed.packages()` as per CRAN guidelines.  
   - Removed `install.packages()` from all scripts.  

3. **Fixed `on.exit()` Requirement**  
   - Ensured `download_ffmpeg.R` properly restores timeout settings using `on.exit(options(timeout = old_timeout))`.  

4. **Updated Dependency Handling**  
   - Removed `requireNamespace()` where unnecessary and used `::` notation for imported functions.  
   - Removed `tools` from `Imports:` in `DESCRIPTION` (since it is part of base R).  

5. **Enhanced Error Handling for 'FFmpeg' Download**  
   - If the URL is unreachable, users are now provided with alternative manual download links.  
   - Improved instructions on where to place `ffmpeg.exe`.
   - Fixed `download_ffmpeg()` test failure by skipping it on CRAN.
   - Improved test handling to ensure compatibility with CRAN's non-interactive environment.
   - Verified that all tests pass successfully on Windows. 

This submission addresses all CRAN review comments.
